<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This tutorial covers an implementation of Divide and Recombine (D&amp;R) in the R statistical programming 
environment, an R package called <code>RHIPE</code>. This is one component of the Tessera environment for the 
analysis of large complex data.</p>

<p>We are going to demonstrate how to process <code>RHIPE</code> jobs on a cluster which is running Linux operating 
system in the following sessions. The cluster is consist of two types of servers. One is an initiating 
R server which is the front-end. Another one is the Hadoop servers where the HDFS is sitting and also where
<code>RHIPE</code> job will be distributed to. We call those servers as back-end. The front-end may or may not be 
one of the Hadoop servers, either situation will be fine for <code>RHIPE</code> job. It will be decided by the 
cluster administrator.</p>

<p>Begin by connecting via ssh to the initiating R server from your laptop or desktop. Now you are sitting 
on the initiating R server, then start an interactive R session. In later on sessions, we will mention 
about a local R current working directory. Local here means on the front-end, not your laptop or desktop.
So this working directory is on the initiating R server. All files like dataset, results, or plots you 
created will be transferred between this working directory on the initiating R server and the HDFS on the
back-end. In summary, you will sit in front of your laptop starting an R session on initiating R server 
and submitting <code>RHIPE</code> job which will be distributed to the back-end Hadoop servers.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='information-about-data'>
<h3>Information about Data</h3>

<p>We introduce <code>RHIPE</code> using
housing data that consist of 7 monthly variables on housing sales from Oct
2008 to Mar 2014 for 2883 counties in the 49 U.S. states, excluding Hawaii and
Alaska, but including the District of Columbia which for simplicity here we
will refer to as a ``state&#39;&#39;.  The data were harvested from Quandl&#39;s Zillow
Housing Data. The data contain 224,369 sales of housing units.</p>

<p>The variables are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>FIPS</strong>: FIPS county code, an unique identifier for each U.S. county</li>
<li><strong>county</strong>: county name</li>
<li><strong>state</strong>: state abbreviation</li>
<li><strong>date</strong>: time measured in months, from 1 to 66, the number of months</li>
<li><strong>units</strong>: number of units sold</li>
<li><strong>list</strong>: monthly median list price (dollars per square foot)</li>
<li><strong>selling</strong>: monthly median selling (dollars per square foot)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many observations of the last three variables are missing: units 68%, list 7%,
and selling 68%.</p>

<p>The raw data are in a text file whose size is about 8 MB.
It is available as <code>housing.txt</code> in our Tesseradata Github repository of the
<code>RHIPE</code> documentation <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaosutong/docs-RHIPE/gh-pages/housing.txt">here</a>.   </p>

<p>So the raw data are a table with 190,278 rows (units) and 7 columns (variables).
In the text file, the fields in each row are separated by a comma, and there
are not headers
Here are the first few lines of the file:</p>

<pre><code>01001,Autauga,AL,1,27,96.616541353383,99.1324
01001,Autauga,AL,2,28,96.856993190152,95.8209
01001,Autauga,AL,3,16,98.055555555556,96.3528
01001,Autauga,AL,4,23,97.747480735033,95.2189
01001,Autauga,AL,5,22,97.747480735033,92.7127
</code></pre>

<p>A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a
single room that is occupied or intended to occupied  as
separate living quarter. Separate living quarters are those in which the
occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the 
building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or
through a common hall.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='write-text-to-hdfs'>
<h3>Write Text to HDFS</h3>

<p>First of all, you can double-check the name of your local working directory with the <code>getwd</code> command
in R.  Mine is called &quot;/home/median/u41/tongx&quot; but yours will be different.</p>

<pre><code class="r">getwd()
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[1] &quot;/home/median/u41/tongx&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Recall that this directory is on the initiating R server. Then download the data file to your 
local working directory with the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="r">system(&quot;wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaosutong/docs-RHIPE/gh-pages/housing.txt&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>If it downloaded properly, then &quot;housing.txt&quot; will show up in the output of this command, which lists files
in your local working directory:</p>

<pre><code class="r">list.files(&quot;.&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you&#39;ve already installed <code>RHIPE</code> using the instructions provided.
Every time we use <code>RHIPE</code>, we have to call the <code>RHIPE</code> library in R and initialize it.  Your values
for <code>zips</code> and <code>runner</code> might be different than these, depending on the details of your installation.</p>

<pre><code class="r">library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
rhoptions(zips = &quot;/ln/share/RhipeLib.tar.gz&quot;)
rhoptions(runner = &quot;sh ./RhipeLib/library/Rhipe/bin/RhipeMapReduce.sh&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we want to copy the raw text file to the HDFS.  The function that writes files to HDFS is <code>rhput()</code>.<br>
Replace <code>tongx</code> with an appropriate HDFS directory, such as your user name.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhput(&quot;./housing.txt&quot;, &quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rhput</code> function takes two arguments.
The first argument is the path to the local file to be copied, and the second argument is the HDFS path where
the file will be written. <code>rhput</code> creates the file at destination, overwriting the destination if
it already exists.  We can also copy files onto HDFS via Hadoop&#39;s command line interface, but
<code>RHIPE</code> allows us to achieve this task from within R.</p>

<p>We can confirm that the housing data text file has been written to HDFS with the <code>rhexists</code> function.
Make sure you specify the same directory as you used in the last step.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhexists(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[1] TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to see more details about a file or directory on HDFS, we can use <code>rhls()</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  permission owner      group     size          modtime                            file
1 -rw-rw-rw- tongx supergroup 7.683 mb 2014-09-17 11:11   /ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt
</code></pre>

<p><code>rhls()</code> is very similar to the bash command <code>ls</code>.  It will list all content under a given address. 
We can see that the <code>housing.txt</code> file with size 11.82Mb is located under <code>/user/tongx/housing/</code> 
on HDFS.</p>

<p>With our data on the HDFS, we are ready to start a D&amp;R analysis.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='read-and-divide-by-state'>
<h3>Read and Divide by State</h3>

<p>The first step in a D&amp;R analysis is to choose a division method and create subsets.  We&#39;ll
divide the housing data by state. <code>RHIPE</code> allows us to read the raw text file on HDFS and 
create a copy of the data broken into subsets using a MapReduce job.  The original data file
will remain on HDFS. The data within each subset will be stored as R objects, rather than raw
text.  This will allow us to apply subsequent data analytic and visual methods using familiar
R commands.</p>

<p>In the MapReduce framework, we keep track of subsets as key-value pairs.  The key is a identifier for
the subset.  It&#39;s usually a small data object, like a single number or character string.  There
can be multiple subsets that share a common key.  The value is where we store the data.  For 
example, it may be an R data frame.</p>

<p>The map is a function applied to every key-value pair.  Its output is one or more key-value
pairs, where the key may or may not have changed from the input key.  The output key-value 
pairs of the map are sometimes called intermediate key-value pairs, because they will be the
input to the reduce function.  The intermediate key-value pairs are grouped by key, and then
the reduce function is applied to each group.  The output of the reduce function is again
one or more key-value pairs.  <code>RHIPE</code> allows us to write the map and reduce functions in
R code, using R objects for the keys and values.</p>

<p>A valid MapReduce job in Rhipe consists of a map expression, an optional reduce expression, 
and an execution function <code>rhwatch()</code>.  If no reduce expression is given, the output of the
map is the final output.</p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map1 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    line = strsplit(map.values[[r]], &quot;,&quot;)[[1]]
    key &lt;- line[3]
    value &lt;- as.data.frame(rbind(line[-3]), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    names(value) &lt;- c(
      &quot;FIPS&quot;, &quot;county&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, 
      &quot;units&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;selling&quot;
    )
    value$list &lt;- as.numeric(value$list)
    value$selling &lt;- as.numeric(value$selling)
    value$units &lt;- as.numeric(value$units)
    rhcollect(key, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>The input keys are line numbers in the housing data text file.  They are the elements of the list
object <code>map.keys</code>.  The input values are the lines of text, which are the elements of the list 
object <code>map.values</code>. This is the default when the input is a raw text file.  For each input key-value 
pair, <code>rhcollect</code> emits an intermediate key-value pair, where the key is the state name (the third 
field in the comma-separated line) and the value is all other fields in the line, stored as a data 
frame with a single row.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce1 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    oneState &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    oneState &lt;- rbind(oneState, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    attr(oneState, &quot;state&quot;) &lt;- reduce.key
    rhcollect(reduce.key, oneState)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>Between the map and reduce stages, the intermediate key-value pairs are grouped by key (the state name).
The current group&#39;s key is available in the object <code>reduce.key</code>, and all values associated with that key
are elements of the list object <code>reduce.values</code>.  The reduce expression has three parts: <code>pre</code>, which is 
executed once first; <code>reduce</code>, which is executed repeatedly until all intermediate values associated with
the current key have been processed; and <code>post</code>, which is executed once at the end.  </p>

<p>In the reduce expression above, our goal is to combine all observations associated with one particular
state into a single data frame.  In <code>pre</code>, we initialize an empty data frame, <code>oneState</code>.  In <code>reduce</code>, 
we use <code>rbind</code>
to combine all observations associated with one particular state.  In <code>post</code>, we add an attribute to the
data frame containing the state name and emit the final key-value
pair.  The key is the state name, and the value is the data frame with all observations belonging to
that state.  These final key-value pairs are written to HDFS, and will persist for subsequent analyses.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">mr1 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map1,
  reduce   = reduce1,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byState&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10
  ),
  readback = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rhwatch</code> function packages and executes our <code>RHIPE</code> MapReduce job.  In addition to the <code>map</code> and
<code>reduce</code> expressions created above, we specify the HDFS locations of the input and output for this
MapReduce job.  The input is the location where we stored our raw text file using <code>rhput</code> in the
previous section.  The output is any location on HDFS we choose.  Be careful, as any existing data
in the output location will be overwritten.</p>

<p>The <code>mapred</code> argument contains optional configuration parameters for the MapReduce job.  In this
case, we&#39;ve specified 10 reduce tasks using <code>mapred.reduce.tasks</code>.  This means that of the 49 groups
of key-value pairs corresponding to the 49 states in our data set, 10 at a time will be processed
in parallel.  Specifying 10 reduce tasks also means that the output written to HDFS will be broken
into 10 files (we&#39;ll come back to this point in the next section).  Finally, <code>readback = FALSE</code> 
tells <code>RHIPE</code> not to read the final output from HDFS into global environment of our interactive R 
session.  We&#39;ll do that with a separate command. </p>

<p>After our job has completed successfully, the output will be in the location we specified on the HDFS.
Since this data set is quite small, we can read the whole thing from HDFS into our interactive R
environment using <code>rhread</code>.  All we have to specify is the HDFS location we wish to read from.</p>

<pre><code class="r">stateSubsets &lt;- rhread(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byState&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Read 49 objects(13.52 MB) in 1.41 seconds
</code></pre>

<p><code>RHIPE</code> conveniently packages the key-value pairs in our HDFS output location as a nested list, which we&#39;ve
assigned to the variable <code>stateSubsets</code>.  Since there were 49 key-value pairs in the output of our reduce
stage, there are 49 elements in <code>stateSubsets</code>.  Each element is itself a list with two elements: a key
and a value.  In this case, the keys are character strings containing the state names, and the 
values are data frames, just as they should be based on our reduce code.</p>

<p>We can take a look at the data frame contained in the first key-value pair.  The key-value pairs
are in no particular order.    </p>

<pre><code class="r">head(stateSubsets[[1]][[2]])
</code></pre>

<p>We can also look at the structure of <code>stateSubsets</code> and confirm that it&#39;s what we expected.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve now successfully divided our data into subsets and stored each subset as an R object.<br>
They will persist on HDFS and be used for many analytic methods, each applied using <code>RHIPE</code>. </p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='compute-state--means'>
<h3>Compute State  Means</h3>

<p>Now we&#39;ll apply an analytic method to the subsets of our housing data.  Our analytic
method will be to take the mean.  We have monthly list prices and sale prices per square foot, 
so our desired output is two numbers for each state: a mean of list prices and a mean 
of sale prices.  The recombination step will be to put all the state means in a single data
frame, which can be further analyzed in an interactive R session.</p>

<p>We apply our chosen analytic method with a second <code>RHIPE</code> MapReduce job:</p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map2 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    value &lt;- data.frame(
      state = attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;state&quot;),
      listMean = mean(map.values[[r]]$list, na.rm = TRUE),
      saleMean = mean(map.values[[r]]$selling, na.rm = TRUE),
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
    rhcollect(1, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>The input to our map is the the final output we created in the previous section.  The keys 
were state names, stored as character objects, and the values were data frames with prices,
dates, and county information.  In general, 
keys need not be unique, but in this case we know that there are 49 state names, where no state
is duplicated.  </p>

<p>To each state&#39;s data frame, we apply the same action: take the mean of the list price and 
the mean of the sale price.  These are stored in a single row data frame to be recombined in 
the reduce step below.  The row has three columns: state name plus the two calculated means.
As before, <code>rhcollect</code> emits intermediate key-value pairs.  One key-value pair is emitted per
state.  The value is the single row data frame we just created.  We use the same key for all 49
states so that they will all appear together in the reduce step.  The key itself is meaningless,
so we&#39;ll use 1 as a placeholder.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce2 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    allMeans &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    allMeans &lt;- rbind(allMeans, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    rhcollect(reduce.key, allMeans)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>We divided our data into subsets and applied an analytic method to each subset.  The reduce step
above is our recombination.  We recombine the state means into a data frame with 49 rows and 3
columns.  Later, we can read that data frame from HDFS into our interactive R session for further
analysis.</p>

<p>The input key is the placeholder value 1, which is left unchanged as the output key.  The input
values are the single row data frames for each state, and the output values is the 49 row data 
frame with all states represented.  In the <code>pre</code> step we initialize an empty data frame.  In
<code>reduce</code> we use <code>rbind</code> to append the single row data frames to the empty data frame we created, 
and in <code>post</code> we use <code>rhcollect</code> to emit the final output so that it will be written to HDFS.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">stateMeans &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map2,
  reduce   = reduce2,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byState&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/meanByState&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list( 
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 5
  ),
  readback = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>rhwatch()</code> this time, we&#39;ve changed several arguments. First, in the <code>rhfmt</code> of <code>input</code> argument,
<code>type</code> is specified to be &quot;sequence&quot;, since the input file to this mapreduce job is the output
from our division. This indicates to <code>RHIPE</code> that the input is not a raw text file, but rather a 
file already organized as key-value pairs.  Also we request 5 reduce tasks for this job using
the <code>mapred.reduce.tasks</code> option.  Finally, we assign
<code>readback</code> to be <code>TRUE</code>. By doing this, the final results not only will be saved on HDFS, but also
will be read back from HDFS (without using <code>rhread()</code>) and assigned to an object in our interactive R
session.  We&#39;ve named that object <code>stateMeans</code>.</p>

<p>Just as before, once we submit the job, we see job status information.</p>

<p>As we can see, the result is a list of length 1.  This make sense, since we only output a single

another for the value.  The value is what we&#39;re interested in, namely, the data frame of 49 state means.

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at how the output was stored on HDFS using <code>rhls</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/meanByState&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  permission owner      group        size          modtime                                         file

</code></pre>

<p>There are five files in &quot;/ln/tongx/housing/meansByState&quot;, named from &quot;part-r-00000&quot; to 
&quot;part-r-00004&quot;. There are five of these because we selected 5 reduce tasks with <code>mapred.reduce.tasks</code>.
Besides these five files, there are another two files named &quot;_SUCCESS&quot; and 
&quot;_logs&quot; which record the metadata and log information. </p>

<p>Notice that four of the five files have the same size, 94 bytes, which is quite small. 
This is because those four files are 
empty. Since we only had one intermediate key-value pair (the output of the map), four of the 
reduce tasks we requested did nothing.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve now successfully completed our first D&amp;R analysis with <code>RHIPE</code>.  We created a division by state, applied an
analytic method to each subset when we took the mean, and recombined the subset outputs into an R
data frame for further interactive analysis.  We did the division in one Rhipe MapReduce job, and 
the analytic method and recombination in a second job.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='read-and-divide-by-county'>
<h3>Read and Divide by County</h3>

<p>As we showed previously, we divided the whole data set to subsets by state, and then calculated the mean list
and selling price for each state. According to different purpose of the data analysis, we sometime would
like to divide the data set by different variables. So we are going to show that what if we divide our housing
data by county from the text file as well.</p>

<p>The input keys are line numbers in the housing data text file.  They are the elements of the list
object <code>map.keys</code>.  The input values are the lines of text, which are the elements of the list object <code>map.values</code>.
This is the default when the input is a raw text file.  For each input key-value pair, <code>rhcollect</code> emits an
intermediate key-value pair, where the key is the state name (the third field in the comma-separated
line) and the value is all other fields in the line, stored as a data frame with a single row.</p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map3 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    line = strsplit(map.values[[r]], &quot;,&quot;)[[1]]
    key &lt;- line[1:3]
    value &lt;- as.data.frame(rbind(line[c(-1, -2, -3)]), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    names(value) &lt;- c(&quot;date&quot;, &quot;units&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;selling&quot;)
    value$list &lt;- as.numeric(value$list)
    value$selling &lt;- as.numeric(value$selling)
    rhcollect(key, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we want to use the FIPS code as a unique identifier for the county, since counties in
different states can share a common name.  This time we&#39;ve used a character vector of length 3
as the key.  It contains the unique FIPS code, the county name, and the state name.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce3 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    oneCounty &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    oneCounty &lt;- rbind(oneCounty, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    attr(oneCounty, &quot;FIPS&quot;) &lt;- reduce.key[1]
    attr(oneCounty, &quot;county&quot;) &lt;- reduce.key[2]
    attr(oneCounty, &quot;state&quot;) &lt;- reduce.key[3]
    rhcollect(reduce.key, oneCounty)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>By removing the FIPS, county, and state columns from the data frame and storing them as
attributes, we&#39;ve eliminated redundant information in each data frame. Working with massive 
data sets, we want our data to take up the least possible space on disk in order to save 
read/write time.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">mr3 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map3,
  reduce   = reduce3,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byCounty&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10
  ),
  readback = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>After the job completes successfully, we&#39;ll read the results from HDFS into our interactive R 
session as we did before.  This time, let&#39;s use the <code>max</code> argument to <code>rhread</code>, which specifies 
how many key-value pairs to read. The default value is -1, which means read in all key-value pairs.</p>

<pre><code class="r">countySubsets &lt;- rhread(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byCounty&quot;, max = 10)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Read 10 objects(31.39 KB) in 0.04 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose we want to see all 10 keys that we read.  Recall that key-value pairs are stored as a nested
list.  So what we want is the first element of each element in the list.  We can use <code>lapply</code> to get
them:</p>

<pre><code class="r">keys &lt;- unlist(lapply(countySubsets, &quot;[[&quot;, 1))
keys
</code></pre>

<pre><code> [1] &quot;01013&quot; &quot;01031&quot; &quot;01059&quot; &quot;01077&quot; &quot;01095&quot; &quot;01103&quot; &quot;01121&quot; &quot;04001&quot; &quot;05019&quot; &quot;05037&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let&#39;s check that we have the FIPS code, state name, and county name information saved as 
attributes of the data frame.</p>

<pre><code class="r">attributes(countySubsets[[1]][[2]])
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$names

<div class='tab-pane' id='compute-county-means'>
<h3>Compute County Means</h3>

<p>We calculate the mean list price and mean sale price by county exactly the same way we 
calculated them by state. </p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map4 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    value &lt;- data.frame(
      listMean = mean(map.values[[r]]$list, na.rm = TRUE),
      saleMean = mean(map.values[[r]]$selling, na.rm = TRUE),
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
    value$state &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;state&quot;)
    value$county &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;county&quot;)
    value$FIPS &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;FIPS&quot;)
    rhcollect(1, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>In the map expression, we create a single row data frame for each county. The data frame has five
columns: FIPS, listMean, saleMean, state, and county name. FIPS code, state name, and county name 
can be found in the attributes of each element of <code>map.values</code>. In order to combine all means by
county into one data frame, we will assign 1 to be the key for all intermediate key-value pairs.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce4 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    countyMeans &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    countyMeans &lt;- rbind(countyMeans, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    rhcollect(reduce.key, countyMeans)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>We can use the same reduce expression which we used to find the means by state. The final output
consists of one key-value pair, where the key is 1, and value is the data frame with all county
means.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">meansByCounty &lt;- rhwatch(

  mapred   = list( 
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 1
  ),
  readback = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<p>This time we specify only one reduce task by setting <code>mapred.reduce.tasks</code> to be 1.
Since we know there is only one
key-value pair in the output, we only need one output file. Eliminating unnecessary output files 
can speed up this job and future jobs which read its output.</p>

<h3>Read and Divide by Month</h3>

<p>Same as before, we can create the subsets of dataset divided by time variable. But here one of
potential problem that we may face is that what if some of the subsets are very large? This is
a very general problem if we are dealing with a large and complex dataset. In fact, <code>RHIPE</code> is 
able to write any size of one subset to HDFS, but only can read one subset less than 256 Mb 
from HDFS. In other words, we are able to create any size of subset in a mapreduce job, but we
will get issue when we are trying to read and apply analysis method on oversize subset.</p>

<p>In this example, we are assuming that each subset by time is oversize. One way to overcome this
issue is that we are going to create multiple subsets for each month. </p>

<p>There is not too much difference in the map expression comparing with the map expression in previous 
two division sessions. We used the fourth column in each row of text file as the key which is the index
of month, and rest of columns saved as a data frame was collected as corresponding value.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce5 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
  },
  reduce = {
    time500 &lt;- do.call(rbind, reduce.values)
    names(time500) &lt;- c(
      &quot;fips&quot;, &quot;county&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, 
      &quot;units&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;selling&quot;
    )
    time500$list &lt;- as.numeric(time500$list)
    time500$selling &lt;- as.numeric(time500$selling)
    rhcollect(reduce.key, time500)
  },
  post = {
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the reduce expression is not similar as before. We left <code>pre</code> and <code>post</code> as empty. Recall that <code>pre</code> 
and <code>post</code> in reduce expression will be executed only once for each unique key. <code>reduce</code> part, on the other 
hand, will be executed repeatedly until all intermediate values associated with the current key have been 
processed. And we actually can control how many intermediate values to be executed in <code>reduce</code> every time. 
Suppose we want to execute 500 intermediate values for each key at one time, then the <code>reduce.values</code> is a 
list only includes 500 intermediate values for corresponding <code>reduce.key</code>. In other words, we use the 
property that intermediate values for a given key can be executed by part in <code>reduce</code> to create 
multiple subsets for a given key. Previously we only created one subset for a given key, like a state or 
county.</p>

<p>What we have done above in <code>reduce</code> is for a given key, for every 500 (later one we will illustrate where 
we specified this 500) intermediate value corresponding to this key, we created a data.frame named
<code>time500</code> which is the row-bind of all these 500 rows(recall that each value is a data frame with single 
row from map output) for this key. Then we collected <code>time500</code> as value with the key. Then is the next
500 rows for the same key, repeatedly until all rows for this key has been processed. If, for example, for 
one key we have 1324 values(rows), then finally we will get three key-value pairs with same key by using 
this reduce expression.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">mr5 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map5,
  reduce   = reduce5,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/bytime&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10,
    rhipe_reduce_buff_size = 500
  ),
  readback = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>rhwatch</code> this time, we add one more argument in <code>mapred</code> list. <code>rhipe_reduce_buff_size</code> is the 
argument used to control how many intermediate values for one key we want to process at one time. It is
where we specified that process 500 rows for one key at one time, as we mentioned in reduce expression.</p>

<p>Let us examine if we got what we want. Recall that we have 2,883 counties in total, and each county has
66 monthly observations. If we only create one subset for each month, there should be 66 subsets, each of
which is a data frame with 2,883 rows.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rst &lt;- rhread(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/bytime&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Read 396 objects(8.85 MB) in 2.76 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>But we got 396 subsets in <code>rst</code>, which is 66 times 6. And if you examine the <code>rst</code> more carefully, it is
not hard to find that for each month, we created 6 subsets.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rows &lt;- unlist(lapply(rst, function(r){dim(r[[2]])[1]}))
rows
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  [1] 500 500 500 500 500 383 500 500 500 500 500 383 500 500 500 500 500 383 500 500 500 500
 [23] 500 383 500 500 500 500 500 383 500 500 500 500 500 383 500 500 500 500 500 383 500 500
......
</code></pre>

<p>What we got above is the number of rows in each subset. We can see that we always have five <code>500</code> and one 
<code>383</code> as one replicate, which together will be the total number of rows for one month. This means we ran 
our <code>reduce</code> in reduce expression six times for each key.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='compute-total-sold-units'>
<h3>Compute Total Sold Units</h3>

<p>We then would like to calculate the total sold units for every month based on the month division.
One thing we should keep in mind about the month division is that we have 6 subsets for each month.
And this will be the main reason that we want to consider one of the optimization method in <code>RHIPE</code>.</p>

<h4>Combiner as an Optimization</h4>

<p>Between the map phase and reduce phase of a MapReduce job, Hadoop sends all the intermediate values
for a given key to the reducer. The intermediate values for a given key are located on several compute 
nodes and need to be shuffled (sent across the network) to the node assigned the processing of that
intermediate key. This involves a lot of network transfer.</p>

<p>Some operations do not need access to all of the data (intermediate values), i.e they can compute on 
subsets and order does not matter, i.e associative and commutative operations. For example, the minimum, 
or the sum, of some numbers. In these cases, a combiner can be useful.</p>

<p>The idea of the combiner is that the reduce is first run locally on mapper outputs before they are sent 
for the final reduce. When the combiner is enabled, the reduction occurs just after the map phase on a 
subset of intermediate values for a given intermediate keys. The output of this is then sent to the 
reducer. This greatly reduces network transfer and accelerates the job speed, especially if the output 
from a map contains a lot of data.</p>

<h4>Enabling Combiner in RHIPE</h4>

<p>Combiner can be enabled in <code>RHIPE</code> by specifying <code>combiner = TRUE</code> when calling function <code>rhwatch()</code>.</p>

<p>To be able to use a combiner, our reduce expression needs to pass the same data type as it receives,
i.e the two arguments in the function rhcollect() in your map expression need to be of the same type as 
those in the function rhcollect() in your reduce expression. For example, if you pass a string as the key
and a numeric vector as the value in the map expression, you need to pass a string as key and a numeric 
vector as the value in the reduce expression as well.</p>

<p>We will demonstrate the usage of combiners through the following examples. First, let us look at how to 
achieve this task without using a combiner.</p>

<h4>Without Combiner</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map6 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    key &lt;- map.keys[[r]]
    value &lt;- sum(as.numeric(map.values[[r]]$units), na.rm = TRUE)
    rhcollect(key, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>In the map expression, we calculated the sum of the sold units for each subset. Since month index is the
input key, and we have 6 subsets for each key, there will be 6 key-value pairs for each month. The value
of each key-value pair is the summation of number of sold units in corresponding subset. So totally there
will be 396 intermediate key-value pairs as output of map expression.</p>

<pre><code class="r">reduce6 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    count &lt;- 0
  },
  reduce = {
    count &lt;- count + sum(unlist(reduce.values), na.rm = TRUE)
  },
  post = {
    rhcollect(reduce.key, count)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the reduce expression, we grouped all 6 summation for each unique key(month index), and calculated
the overall summation for each month</p>

<pre><code class="r">mr6 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map       = map6,
  reduce    = reduce6,
  input     = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/bytime&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  output    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/soldbytime&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred    = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10
  ),
  jobname   = &quot;total sold unit for each month&quot;,
  mon.sec   = 10,
  combiner  = FALSE,
  readback  = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>The default for combiner is <code>FALSE</code>, which is what we have used before. We also specified two more
arguments in <code>rhwatch</code> which are <code>mon.sec</code> and <code>jobname</code>. Both of them are easy to understand. <code>mon.sec</code>
is a numeric integer which specifies how often in terms of second the job status will be reported in R after
the job is submitted. As we seen in &quot;Division by State&quot; session, after job is submitted, we would see job
status every 5 seconds which is the default value of <code>mon.sec</code>. <code>jobname</code> is a string that we can used to 
name our job. The default job name is the date and time when job is submitted.</p>

<h4>With Combiner</h4>

<p>Now let us see how to do the same task with combiner.</p>

<pre><code class="r">mr7 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map       = map6,
  reduce    = reduce6,
  input     = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/bytime&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  output    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/soldbytime.combiner&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred    = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10
  ),
  jobname   = &quot;total sold unit for each month with combiner&quot;,
  mon.sec   = 10,
  combiner  = TRUE,
  readback  = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>The map and reduce expression for combiner situation will be exactly same as the situation without combiner.
The only difference is that we changed the <code>combiner</code> argument in <code>rhwatch</code> to be <code>TRUE</code> to active the 
combiner. So what happened when combiner was active was nothing but each mapper(server or node that ran map
expression) run the reduce expression before it generated intermediate key-value pairs.</p>

<p>For this example,
one of the mapper may generated two out of six summation for one month. Without combiner, these two 
summation will be transferred with other four summation which calculated on another mapper to one reducer
(server or node that ran reduce expression). With combiner, however, these two summation will be first 
summed up together then only one key-value pairs will be transferred to the reducer instead of two. This
will be a huge difference with respect to transferring time when we have very many or very large size of 
values related to one key.</p>

<p>Finally, we can double check if combiner active or not will effect the final result.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rst.comb &lt;- rhread(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/soldbytime.combiner&quot;)
rst &lt;- rhread(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/soldbytime&quot;)
identical(rst, rst.comb)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[1] TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that the final results from these two jobs are identical. We also can convert the results
to be a data frame with following code:</p>

<pre><code class="r">df &lt;- data.frame(  
  time  = sapply(rst, &quot;[[&quot;, 1),
  total = sapply(rst, &quot;[[&quot;, 2)
)
df &lt;- df[order(df$time, decreasing = FALSE), ]  
df.comb &lt;- data.frame(  
  time  = sapply(rst.comb, &quot;[[&quot;, 1),
  total = sapply(rst.comb, &quot;[[&quot;, 2)
)
df.comb &lt;- df.comb[order(df.comb$time, decreasing = FALSE), ]
head(df.comb)
head(df)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>         time  total
45 2008-10-01 272879
50 2008-11-01 201648

<div class='tab-pane' id='division-by-state-from-county-division'>
<h3>Division by State from County Division</h3>

<p>In the previous two divisions, we started from raw text data, where input key-value pairs were each row
of the text file. In some cases it might be more efficient to go from one subset division method to
another.  Either way, it&#39;s a good thing to know how to do.  In this section we&#39;ll recreate the 
division by state from the division by county.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start by removing our existing state subsets from the HDFS so there aren&#39;t too many copies
floating around.  We can delete files from the HDFS using the <code>rhdel</code> function.  It only requires
one argument - the directory to be deleted - and it recursively deletes any subdirectories or files.</p>

<p>We can use <code>rhls</code> to see that the division by state is on the HDFS, right where we put it:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Philip, you should put the output of rhls right here
</code></pre>

<p>We can delete it with the <code>rhdel</code> function:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhdel(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byState&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Philip, you should put the output of rhdel right here
</code></pre>

<p>And we can use <code>rhls</code> again to see that we were successful:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Philip, you should put the new output of rhls right here
</code></pre>

<p>As long as we&#39;re talking about HDFS file management, let&#39;s try out a few more functions.  Suppose
we want to make a copy of the original text file on the HDFS.  We can use the
<code>rhcp</code> function.  It takes two arguments.  The first is the source, or the directory on HDFS we 
want to copy.  The second is the target, or location for the new copy.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhcp(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;, &quot;/ln/tongx/housing/tmp/housing.txt&quot;)
rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/tmp&quot;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Philip, you should put the output of rhls here
</code></pre>

<p>We can use <code>rhmv</code> to move the text file to a different folder.  This
function also takes two arguments, just like <code>rhcp</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhmv(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/tmp/housing.txt&quot;, &quot;/ln/tongx/housing/tmp2/housing.txt&quot;)
rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/&quot;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Philip, you should put the output of rhls here
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s enough file management.  Now let&#39;s recreate the division by state from the division by 
county, which is still on the HDFS.</p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map9 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    key &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;state&quot;)
    value &lt;- map.values[[r]]
    value$FIPS &lt;- attr(map.keys[[r]], &quot;FIPS&quot;)
    value$county &lt;- attr(map.keys[[r]], &quot;county&quot;)
    rhcollect(key, value)
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>The most important part of this map expression is the key we assigned.  Our input key was the length 3
character vector containing FIPS code, county name, and state name.  Our output key is the state
name only.  This ensures that the data frames of all the counties belonging to a single state go to
a single reduce task, so that we can combine them into a single data frame for that state.  Meanwhile,
we also want to make the FIPS code and county name columns of our data frame again.</p>

<h4>Reduce</h4>

<pre><code class="r">reduce9 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    combine &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    combine &lt;- rbind(combine, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    rhcollect(reduce.key, combine)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>We can use the same reduce expression that we used in the first division by state.  But keep in mind
that this time, the intermediate key-value pairs are different.  Before there was one key-value pair
for each line of the text file, but now there is one for each county.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">mr9 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map9,
  reduce   = reduce9,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byCounty&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byState&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list( 
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10
  ),
  readback = FALSE,
  noeval = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<p>Here we did something new in the <code>rhwatch</code> function.  We set the <code>noeval</code> argument to indicate
that we don&#39;t want to run this job, we just want to package it to be run later.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t see any output, because no commands have been sent to Hadoop.  Instead, the packaged
job has been stored in the <code>mr5</code> object.  When we&#39;re ready to run the job, we call <code>rhex()</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">byState &lt;- rhex(mr5, async = FALSE)
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument to <code>rhex</code> is the packaged job we just created.  The second argument <code>async</code> 
specifies whether the job should be run asynchronously.  If we set <code>async = FALSE</code> then we&#39;ll see
continuously updated job status information, and we won&#39;t be able to issue any further R commands
until the job completes.  If we set it to <code>TRUE</code>, which is the default, the job will run in the 
background while we continue to interact with our R session.  It&#39;s similar to the <code>\&amp;</code> command in
a Linux shell.</p>

<p>After the job successfully completes, we&#39;ll have state subsets in the specified output folder
on the HDFS, just as before, but created in a different way.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='access-subset-by-state'>
<h3>Access Subset by State</h3>

<p>As we have already
seen in previous examples, our R objects from a mapreduce job have been saved as a sequence file on HDFS.
We also have seen that how to control the number of key-value pairs we want to read by specifying the <code>max</code>
argument in <code>rhread</code>. However, this can only guarantee we read fixed number of key-value pairs. The order
of the key-value pairs or those R objects saved on HDFS is random. What if we would like to only access 
specific key-value pairs by the key without reading all key-value pairs back into the R global environment?
In other words, can we treat our dataset as a queryable database through <code>RHIPE</code> functions? The answer is
absolutely YES!</p>

<p>In order to achieve this purpose, we have to save our output as a map file instead of sequence file on HDFS.
Map file is another type of file can be saved on HDFS besides text and sequence file. For example, we are 
still trying to get subsets for each state based on the subsets for each county. This time we would like to 
be able to access the subset of data for Indiana state only. The code is showed as following:</p>

<pre><code class="r">map10 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    key &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;state&quot;)
    county &lt;- attr(map.values[[r]], &quot;county&quot;)
    value &lt;- map.values[[r]]
    value$fips &lt;- rep(map.keys[[r]], nrow(value))
    value$county &lt;- rep(county, nrow(value))
    rhcollect(key, value)
  })
})
reduce10 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    combine &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    combine &lt;- rbind(combine, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    rhcollect(reduce.key, combine)
  }
)
mr10 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map10,
  reduce   = reduce10,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/bycounty&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/countytostate.map&quot;, type = &quot;map&quot;),
  mapred   = list( 
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 10
  ),
  readback = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>It is not hard to notice that the only difference between the code above with the code in the previous
session is that the <code>type</code> in <code>output</code> argument in <code>rhwatch</code> function is changed to be <code>map</code>, which means
we are creating a map file output in this mapreduce job. In this mapreduce job, we are doing exactly same
division of the dataset as we did in sequence file, except that we would like to add indexing by key 
property in the output file. And this is the main difference between map file and sequence file. After
the job is finished, we can access a map file with <code>rhmapfile</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rst &lt;- rhmapfile(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/countytostate.map&quot;)
rst
</code></pre>

<pre><code>/ln/tmp/housing/countytostate.map is a MapFile with 10 index files
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">class(rst)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[1] &quot;mapfile&quot;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">object.size(rst)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>264 bytes
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that <code>rst</code> is a MapFile with 10 index files because we specified the reduce tasks number 
to be 10. Its class is <code>mapfile</code>, and size is only 264 bytes, which means we did not read the whole R
object back from HDFS.</p>

<p>Now let us have a deeper look at the output files on HDFS. Recall that &quot;/user/tongx/housing/countytostate&quot;
is the sequence output files, and &quot;/user/tongx/housing/countytostate.map&quot; is the map output files.</p>

<p>We found out that all <code>part-r-</code> files now becomes directory instead of data files. When we go inside of each
<code>part-r-</code> files, we notice that we have two files which are <code>data</code> and <code>index</code>. <code>data</code> file is similar with 
the output in <code>part-r-</code> files we got in sequence output files. We can actually read it by using <code>rhread</code> 
function. The extra <code>index</code> file with size around 200 bytes records all indexing information by key of this 
part file.</p>

<p>Finally, we can access the subset of data frame of Indiana state by:</p>

<h3>Plots by State</h3>

<p>After previous several sessions, we have seen how to do divide and recombine in <code>RHIPE</code>, how to 
access the subset by key. Another useful and powerful aspect of <code>RHIPE</code> is that we can achieve
parallel plotting on cluster. Visualizing each subset can help us to have a better understanding of
the subsets as well as the whole dataset.</p>

<p>For each subset by state, we would like to know what the number of sold units looks like over time
conditional on county. So we will plot the sold units against time for each state. When we are 
facing a relative small data set in base R, this plotting for each state has to be done either using
a for loop or some other package like <code>plyr</code> package. But when we are facing a large data set that
cannot be fit into the memory, previous visualization method will fail easily. </p>

<p>In <code>RHIPE</code>, on the other hand, we can specify multiple tasks, and in each tasks we can plot one or
multiple plots. Later on we will see, in our housing example, we will specify 12 tasks to conduct 
total 49 plots, one plot for state. So each task will handle about 4 plots which will 
dramatically decreasing the total time to finish these 49 plots comparing with doing this using for
loop.</p>

<h4>Time Series Plot of Sold Units</h4>

<p>The first type of plot we are going to plot is the time series plot of number of sold units condition
on county for each state. First of all, let us have a look at what the plot looks like.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/time.vs.unit.NC.pdf">Time series plot of number of units sold for North Carolina State</a>.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/time.vs.unit.TX.pdf">Time series plot of number of units sold for Texas State</a>.</p>

<p>For each state we created the time series plot of the number of sold units conditional on county.
The plotting function we are going to use is in a R package named <code>lattice</code> which is a very powerful
visualization method in R. </p>

<pre><code class="r">map11 &lt;- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    value &lt;- subset(map.values[[r]], !is.na(as.numeric(units)))
    if(nrow(value) != 0) {
      rhcollect(map.keys[[r]], value)
    }
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>In map expression, we read in each subset by state, and then we only collected subsets that is not all <code>NA</code>
for <code>units</code> variable. This can help us illuminate the number of key-value pairs that are transferred to 
reducer.</p>

<pre><code class="r">ylab &lt;- &quot;Log of Number of Sold Units(log base 2)&quot;
xlab &lt;- &quot;Month&quot;
reduce11 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    onestate &lt;- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    onestate &lt;- do.call(rbind, reduce.values)
  },
  post = {
    trellis.device(pdf, 
      file  = paste(&quot;./tmp/time.vs.unit&quot;, reduce.key, &quot;pdf&quot;, sep=&quot;.&quot;), 
      color = TRUE,
      paper = &quot;legal&quot;
    )
    b &lt;- xyplot(
      log2(as.numeric(units)) ~ as.numeric(date) | FIPS,
      data   = onestate,
      layout = c(4, 3),
      cex    = 0.5,
      pch    = 16,
      scales = list(
        x = list(tick.number = 5),
        y = list(relation = &quot;sliced&quot;) 
      ),
      xlab   = xlab,
      ylab   = ylab,
      main   = reduce.key,
    )
    print(b)
    dev.off()    
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>In reduce expression, we did the actual plotting task. One thing should be noticed is that we defined two
string variables <code>xlab</code> and <code>ylab</code> in our initiating R global environment. We will use this two string 
variables as the labels for x axis and y axis respectively. Later on we will show how to let every
task be aware of these two objects. In the <code>post</code>, we called the <code>xyplot</code> function in <code>lattice</code> package to 
plot the <code>units</code> against <code>date</code>, and created a pdf plot file under the location or path of <code>./tmp/</code>. </p>

<p>What is this <code>./tmp/</code> directory? It is a temporary working directory on each reducer. Recall that on the 
initiating R server(front-end), we have a concept of R local working directory. This temporary working 
directory is the same concept but on each sever of the Hadoop severs(back-end). Why we want to save the plots 
to this specific directory on each hadoop sever? Because <code>RHIPE</code> can copy all files in this particular 
directory to HDFS, then we can copy those files from HDFS to our R local working directory on initiating R 
sever. Finally, you can choose to view those files either through the Internet or copy them to your laptop to 
view them.</p>

<pre><code class="r">mr11 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map        = map11,
  reduce     = reduce11,
  input      = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/byState&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  output     = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/timeplotbystate&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  setup      = expression(
    map = {
    },
    reduce   = {
      library(lattice)
    }
  ),
  parameters = list(
    xlab = xlab,
    ylab = ylab
  ),
  mapred     = list( 
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 12
  ),
  copyFiles  = TRUE,
  readback   = FALSE
)
</code></pre>

<p>In the execution function, we saw a group of new arguments shown up. Let&#39;s go through them one by one. First 
is <code>setup</code> argument. It is an expression of R code to be run before map and reduce. Here the <code>map</code> in <code>setup</code>
is empty, but we called <code>lattice</code> library in <code>reduce</code>, because we would like to use the <code>xyplot</code> function in
reduce expression. <code>setup</code> is a very good place for us to set up for map and reduce respectively,like calling
library.</p>

<p>Second is <code>parameters</code> argument. This argument is how we distributed the <code>xlab</code> and <code>ylab</code> to every map and 
reduce task. Basically we group all objects as a list which we would like to use in each task. Then in map
or reduce expression, we can just use these objects in <code>parameters</code> as they have been already defined.</p>

<p>The last one is <code>copyFiles</code>. As we discussed before, when <code>copyFiles</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, all files created in 
<code>./tmp/</code> on each Hadoop severs will be copied to the output directory on HDFS.</p>

<p>Once the job is finished, let&#39;s see what we have in the output directory on HDFS.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/timeplotbystate&quot;)

</code></pre>

<p>Different than all the results we had before, here we got an extra directory named <code>_outputs</code> in output directory.
When we went into it, we found following information:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhls(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/timeplotbystate/_outputs&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>   permission owner      group     size          modtime                                                           file

Yes, all the pdf plots are saved here, on HDFS! The last step would be copy those pdf files from HDFS to our R local
working directory on initiating R server.

</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">rhget(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/timeplotbystate/_outputs/time.vs.unit.NC.pdf&quot;, &quot;./&quot;)
rhget(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/timeplotbystate/_outputs/time.vs.unit.TX.pdf&quot;, &quot;./&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>The function that used to copy from HDFS to R local working directory is <code>rhget</code>, which is the opposite operation as 
<code>rhput</code> we used in previous session. Here we only showed copying two of those pdf files.</p>

<h4>Time Series Plot of List Price</h4>

<p>The second type of plot we are going to plot is the time series plot of list price condition on county for each state.
Again, let us have a look at what the plot looks like.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/list.vs.time.CA.pdf">Time series plot of list price for California State</a>.</p>

<p><a href="./plots/list.vs.time.VA.pdf">Time series plot of list price for Virginia State</a>.</p>

    )
    if(nrow(value) != 0) {
      rhcollect(map.keys[[r]], value)
    }
  })
})
</code></pre>

<p>Same as before, we read in each subset by state in map expression, and then we only collected subsets that is not all 
<code>NA</code> for <code>list</code> variable.</p>

<pre><code class="r">ylab &lt;- &quot;Log of List Price (log base 2 dollars per square foot)&quot;

      file  = paste(&quot;./tmp/list.vs.time&quot;, reduce.key, &quot;pdf&quot;, sep=&quot;.&quot;), 
      color = TRUE,
      paper = &quot;legal&quot;
    )
    b &lt;- xyplot(

      pch    = 16,
      scales = list(
        x = list(tick.number = 7),
        y = list(relation = &quot;sliced&quot;) 
      ),
      xlab   = xlab,
      ylab   = ylab,
      main   = reduce.key, 
    )
    print(b)
    dev.off()    
  }
)

<p>Very similar reduce expression, we did the actual plotting task. This time we changed the <code>ylab</code>. </p>

<h3>Manage RHIPE Jobs</h3>

<p>As you submit more <code>RHIPE</code> jobs, you&#39;ll need to check their status and manage them.  In this short
section, we&#39;ll introduce two new functions to do just that. </p>

<p>First, let&#39;s submit a simple job:</p>

<pre><code class="r">map13 &lt;- expression(
  while(TRUE) {}
)
mr13 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map13,
  input    = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/housing.txt&quot;, type = &quot;text&quot;),
  output   = rhfmt(&quot;/ln/tongx/housing/tmp&quot;, type = &quot;sequence&quot;),
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks = 0
  ),
  readback = FALSE,
  noeval   = TRUE
)
badjob &lt;- rhex(mr6, async = TRUE) 
</code></pre>

<p>We&#39;ve set <code>mapred.reduce.tasks</code> to be 0, because this job omits the optional reduce expression.<br>
The map contains an infinite loop, so this job will never complete. The only purpose for this meaningless
map expression is we want the job is keeping running when we try to access its status. But since we&#39;ve run
this job on the backgroup, we can check its status with <code>rhstatus</code>, which takes as an argument
the object returned by <code>rhex</code>. When we said background, it means that the job is running on the 
Hadoop, and we still have the control ability of R session at the same time. </p>

<pre><code class="r">rhstatus(badjob)

<p>Type <code>ctrl+c</code> to stop the status updates.  Since we know this job won&#39;t ever complete, 
we&#39;ll have to kill it.  Again, use the object returned by <code>rhex</code></p>

<pre><code class="r">rhkill(badjob)
</code></pre>

<p>You can call <code>rhstatus</code> again to see that the job is now in state <code>KILLED</code></p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='introduction'>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll demonstrate the computation ability of <code>RHIPE</code> package with a performance test by using logistic
regression. </p>

<p>The basic idea is firstly, we wish to generate an observation sample with a size of <em>N</em>, <em>V</em> number 
of variables, which means there are \(V-1\) explanatory variables. In summary, we wish to generate a 
dataframe with N rows and V collumns. Secondly, we want to use the logistic regression method to
analyze the dataframe. However, when the data size is quite large, it will be impractical to generate
and analyse the whole data set in terms of the time cosuming and the memory limitation.</p>

<p>Instead, we will use <code>RHIPE</code> package to generate subsets first and then use logistic regression 
method to analyze each subset by R function <code>glm.fit</code>. The subset observation sample size is M and
the number of subsets is R. As a result, \(N = MR\). Each subset contains a sub-dataframe with M rows 
and V collumns. We will use R function <code>system.time</code> to measure elapsed time.</p>

<p>There are two types of elapsed-time computation. The subsets are stored on the HDFS as R objects. 
The first computation type is &quot;O&quot;, the elapsed time to read the subsets from the HDFS and make 
them available to <code>glm.fit</code> in memory as an R objects. The other type, &quot;L&quot;, starts when &quot;O&quot; ends
and it consists of <code>glm.fit</code> computations on the subsets by <code>map</code>, plus `reduce gathering the 
subset estimates and computing the means. However, we cannot measure &quot;L&quot; directly. So we measure 
&quot;O&quot; in one run and \(T = O + L\) in another.</p>

<p>In this example, we will show how to do a sing run of the performance test, which means we only pick
one possible value of M and one possible value of V to see how fast it is to go. </p>

<p>We choose \(n = log2(N) = 27\), \(v = log2(V) = 5\), \(m = log2(M) = 12\), and \(log2(R) = 15\) to illustrate
one single run. So the size for the whole dataset is \(2^{27} \cdot 2^5 \cdot 2^3 = 32GB\). We will 
generate each subset with the size of \(2^{12} \cdot 2^5 \cdot 2^3 = 1MB\)</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='generate-dataset'>
<h3>Generate Dataset</h3>

<p>As we mentioned in the housing data example, the first step in a D&amp;R analysis is to choose a 
division method and create subsets. In this example, we devide the whole dataset to R sets, where
\(log2(R) = 15\). So we will generate 2<sup>15</sup> dataframes with 2<sup>12</sup> rows and 2<sup>5</sup> columns each. </p>

<p>Before we run the map function, we will set up some basic parameters in the front end of R enviroment:</p>

<pre><code class="r">n   &lt;- 27
m   &lt;- 12
v   &lt;- 5
p   &lt;- 2^v - 1
rep &lt;- 1
</code></pre>

<p>Here we define an R object called <code>p</code>, the value of which equals to \(2^v - 1\). As introduced in the
last part, \(2^v\) is the number of variables, so <code>p</code> is the number of the explanatory variables. We 
introduce <code>p</code> here to make the following codes much easier to write and understand. We also specify
the replicate value <code>rep</code> is 1 because we only have a single run of the cluster performance test. But
in your future performance test, you might want to have more replicates for the test, and you can
easily change the value of <code>rep</code>, we will talk about it later.</p>

<h4>Map</h4>

<pre><code class="r">map1 &lt;- expression({
  for (r in map.values){
    set.seed(r)
    value &lt;- matrix(c(rnorm(m*p), sample(c(0,1), m, replace=TRUE)), ncol=p+1)
    rhcollect(r, value)
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, we don&#39;t have an existing data which is different from the housing data example. 
Creating a dataset by randomly simulation is the part of the <code>map</code> job. The input keys and values are
the same by default for the sumulating data step. The keys are numeric numbers 1, 2, ...., R,  where
R is the number of the subsets. In our example, \(log2(R) = log2(N/M) = 15\). They are the elements of
the list object <code>map.keys</code>, which in this case, <code>map.keys</code> and <code>map.values</code> would be the same. The 
output keys from the <code>map1</code> function are the same as the input keys. This is defined by the <code>map1</code> 
function. The output value for each key is a matrix with \(2^{13}\) rows and \(2^5\) columns. As we have
explained in the housing data example, the output key-value pairs from the <code>map</code> function 
are also called intermediate key-value pairs. So <code>rhcollect</code> emits these intermediate key-value 
pairs.</p>

<p>There is no reducer step for the generation part. Next we will write the generated subsets to HDFS.</p>

<h4>Execution Function</h4>

<pre><code class="r">dir.dm  = &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/dm/n27v5m12&quot;
mr1 &lt;- rhwatch(
 map      = map1,
 input    = c(2^(n-m),12),
 output   = dir.dm,
 jobname  = dir.dm,
 mapred   = list(
   mapred.task.timeout=0,
   mapred.reduce.tasks=0),
 parameters = list(m = 2^m, p = p),
 readback = FALSE
  )
</code></pre>

<p>We have introduced the <code>rhwatch</code> function before. In this case, <code>rhwatch</code> function will submit our 
MapReduce jobs to finish the data generation part and write the subsets to HDFS. There are three types
of the <code>input</code> as Text file input, Sequence file input and lapply input. The first two types of input
have been introduced in the housing data example. And in our performance example, the type of 
<code>input</code> is lapply input because we are generating numeric data. The argument <code>input</code> in our 
performance test example is a vector consisting of two elements. The first element specifies the 
input key would be from 1 to \(2^(n-m)\) for <code>map1</code> function. Also, it specifies how many tasks you 
would like Hadoop MapReduce Framework to run because each task conresponds to one key-value pair. 
In our performance test example, each task is to generate a subset with 2<sup>13</sup> rows and 2<sup>5</sup> columns. 
The second element of the vector <code>input</code> specifies the numbers of mappers you would like to use. So 
each mapper would run \(2^{(n-m)}/12\) tasks, where <code>12</code> is the value of the second element of <code>input</code>. 
So the value of the second element would definitely affect the performance test and it is worthy to 
carry out an experiment to test its effect. </p>

<p>The argument <code>parameters</code> passes all the possible values we will need in the Hadoop MapReduce jobs 
to HDFS. In our case, we specify the values of <code>m</code> and <code>p</code> in the front end R, but Hadoop doesn&#39;t 
have these values in the back end. So the argument <code>parameter</code> will packages <code>m</code> and <code>p</code> as a list 
and distribute it to HDFS.</p>

<p>The argument <code>jobname</code> is not neccesary to be set. It is the name of the job, which is visible on 
the Jobtracker website. If not provided, Hadoop MapReduce uses the default name job_date_time_number
e.g. job_201007281701_0274.</p>

<div class='tab-pane' id='elapsed-time-measurement'>
<h3>Elapsed Time Measurement</h3>

<h4>The First Kind Of Elapsed Time -- <strong>O</strong></h4>

<pre><code class="r">timing   &lt;- data.frame()
type  &lt;- &quot;O&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>First, we will initialize a data frame called <code>timing</code> to store these two different kinds of elapsed
time later and create a character <code>type</code> to lable <strong>O</strong> and <strong>T</strong> seperately. </p>

<h5>Map</h5>

<pre><code class="r">map2 &lt;- expression({})
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to notice that <code>map2</code> is an expression with no command. That&#39;s because we only want
to read the data from HDFS to the front end without other operations and then record the reading time .</p>

<h5>Execution Function</h5>

<pre><code class="r">dir.dm  &lt;- &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/dm/n27v5m12&quot;
dir.nf  &lt;- &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/nf/n27v5m12&quot;
mr2 &lt;- rhwatch(
 map      = map2,
 input    = dir.dm,
 output   = dir.nf,
 jobname  = dir.dm,
 mapred   = list(
   mapred.reduce.tasks=0,
   rhipe_map_buff_size=2^15),
 parameters = list(p = p),
 noeval   = TRUE,
 readback = FALSE
  )
t      &lt;- as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr2, async=FALSE)})[3])
t      &lt;- data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
timing &lt;- rbind(timing,t)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Saving 1 parameter to /tmp/rhipe-temp-params-c677abd27e3b1654c25dccadaa7e3483 (use rhclean to delete all temp files)

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>noeval</code> is another very useful argument for <code>rhwatch</code>. By default it is set to be &#39;FALSE&#39;.
In our example, we set <code>noeval</code> equals to &#39;TRUE&#39;, which means the  Hadoop MapReduce job will not run,
and <code>rhwatch</code> just return an R object that contains all the information required by Rhipe to run a 
MapReduce job. Instead, the <code>rhex</code> function will submit the MapReduce job to the Hadoop MapReduce 
framework. </p>

<p>The <code>dir.dm</code> and <code>dir.nf</code> specify the <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> argument of <code>rhwatch</code> function. 
So the first <code>t</code> in the R codes records the first type elapsed time O and the second <code>t</code> is a 
data frame which saves the value of computation <code>type</code>, the value of <code>n</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>v</code>, the number of 
replicate <code>rep</code>, and the value of first type of elapsed time O. Then we use R function <code>rbind</code> 
to combine data frame <code>timing</code> and data frame <code>t</code> by rows. We can take a look at the data frame 
<code>timing</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="r">timing
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  rep  n  m v type       t
1   1 27 12 5    O 253.237
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>timing</code> is a data frame with 1 row and 6 collumns. We will save another type of elapsed time &quot;T&quot;&quot;
into this data frame.</p>

<h4>The Second Kind of Elapsed Time -- <strong>T</strong></h4>

<pre><code class="r">type  &lt;- &quot;T&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>We first specify the value of <code>type</code> as <code>T</code> to identify the second kind of elapsed time <strong>T</strong>.</p>

<h5>Map</h5>

<pre><code class="r">map3 &lt;- expression({
 for (v in map.values) {
  value = glm.fit(v[,1:p],v[,p+1],family=binomial())$coef
  rhcollect(1, value)
 }
})
</code></pre>

<p>The input to our <code>map3</code> is the final output we created in the previous section which the key is from
1 to \(2^{15}\) and the input value is a dataframe with \(2^12\) rows and \(2^5\) collumns. For each subset,
we apply the same action : take the coefficient of the logistic regression for the subset. They are 
stored in a single row dataframe to be recombined in the reduce step below. This single row dataframe
has <code>p</code> collumns. We use the same key for all the subsets so that they wil appear together in the 
reduce step. As before, <code>rhcollect</code> emits intermediate key-value pairs.</p>

<h5>Reduce</h5>

<pre><code class="r">reduce3 &lt;- expression(
  pre = {
    v = rep(0,p) 
    nsub = 0
  },
  reduce = {
    v = v + colSums(matrix(unlist(reduce.values), ncol=p, byrow=TRUE)) 
    nsub = nsub + length(reduce.values)
  },
  post = {
   rhcollect(reduce.key, v/nsub)
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>In the reduce step, we recombine the coefficients from different subset together and sum them up by 
collumn using R function <code>colSums</code> and and get the estimate of the coefficients by the sample mean.</p>

<p>The input key is the placeholder value 1, which is left unchanged as the output key. The input values
are the single row data frames for each subset, and the output values is the single row data frames
consisting of the mean estimate for the coefficients. In <code>post</code>, we use <code>rhcollect</code> to emit the final
output so that it will be written to HDFS.</p>

<h5>Exectution Function</h5>

<pre><code class="r">dir.dm  = &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/dm/n27v5m12&quot;
dir.gf  = &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor/gf/n27v5m12&quot;

mr3 &lt;- rhwatch(
  map      = map3,
  reduce   = reduce3,
  input    = dir.dm,
  output   = dir.gf,
  mapred   = list(
    mapred.reduce.tasks=1,
    rhipe_map_buff_size=10
  ),
 parameters = list(p=p),
 jobname    = dir.gf,
 noeval     = TRUE
)

t &lt;- as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr3, async=FALSE)})[3])
t = data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
timing = rbind(timing,t)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Saving 2 parameters to /tmp/rhipe-temp-params-48fd3131fbae41b13c97ce71393f8aaa (use rhclean to delete all temp files)

</code></pre>

<p>After the job completes successfully, we record the whole elapsed time &quot;T&quot; and save it to the R 
object <code>t</code>. And we save the results to our data frame <code>timing</code>. Till now, we have finished the single
run of the cluster performance test and save the result to a data frame called <code>timing</code>.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='results-of-the-single-run-of-the-performance-test'>
<h3>Results of the Single run of the Performance Test</h3>

<pre><code class="r">timing
</code></pre>

<pre><code>  rep  n  m v type       t
1   1 27 12 5    O 253.237
2   1 27 12 5    T 561.081

</code></pre>

<p>As we can see from the <code>timing</code> dataframe, there are 2 rows and 6 collumns. The last collumn is the 
elapsed time <code>t</code>. As we can see, the elapsed time &quot;O&quot; we need to read the datasets 
from HDFS to the front end is 253.237 seconds which is about 4.2 mins and the whole elapsed time &quot;T&quot; which consists of the 
reading time and the analyzing time is 561.081 seconds, which is less than 9.4 mins. That result is 
impressive! The cluster to run the test here is a very small one with two nodes and 64 GB 
memory in total. You can definitely use RHIPE computation environment to generalize this one sing
run to a full cluster performance test. We will show you the basic idea about how to run a multi-factor experiment in next part.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='a-multi-factor-experiment-for-performance-of-a-cluster'>
<h3>A Multi-Factor Experiment for Performance of a Cluster</h3>

<p>As we can see, <code>RHIPE</code> and its computation environment reduce the time of computation dramatically.
In the last example, we are generating \(2^{27} \cdot 2^5 \cdot 2^3 = 32GB\) data and we finish the 
reading and analysis within 9.4 mins! Actually, the elapsed time depends on many factors. This presents
an opportunity for optimizing the computation even further by making the best choice of the factor. 
Our approach to the optimization is to run statistically designed experiments. This experiment consists
of a lot of factors. There are two different types of elapsed time, which means there is one 
computation-type categorical factor. Three statistical factors  are <code>n</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>v</code>, which are the 
kernel factors for our experiment. There are also two Hadoop HDFS factors and two Hadoop MapReduce 
factors, two hardware factors. In total, we have 10 factors. We also have replicates for each 
combination of these factors. For more details, you can check the paper(link) which describes the 
whole experiment process. In this tutorial, we mainly focus on the computation-type category factor 
<code>type</code>and the three statistical factors <code>n</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>p</code>. We have shown how to run a single run of 
the performance test, so we can easily generalize the single run to the whole performance test 
experiment. We will take the data generation for example.</p>

<h4>Generation Datasets Example</h4>

<pre><code class="r">n.vec   &lt;- c(21,23,25,27)
m.vec   &lt;- seq(8, 16, by=1)
v.vec   &lt;- 4:6
p.vec   &lt;- 2^v.vec - 1
run.vec &lt;- 3
dir.exp &lt;- &quot;/ln/song273/tmp/multi.factor&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>First, we specify some parameters in the frond end of R. The <code>run.vec</code> denotes for each combination 
of <code>m</code>,<code>v</code>, we have 3 replicates. The <code>dir.exp</code> specifies the directory for this experiment on HDFS.</p>

<h5>Map &amp; Execution Function</h5>

<pre><code class="r">for (n in n.vec){
 for (m in m.vec) {
  for (p in p.vec) {
    dir.dm = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/dm/&quot;,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;p&#39;,p,&#39;m&#39;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
    map1
    mr1
  }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>map1</code> and <code>mr1</code> are the map function and the execution function seperately we write in the datasets 
generation part of the single run example. There is a single run for each fixed value of <code>m</code> and <code>p</code>,
So the idea is to put the single run code to a for-loop. And the for-loop contains multinumber of 
MapReduce jobs. The <code>dir.dm</code> specifies the output location for each MapReduce job. </p>

<p>It is noteworthy that we only generate subsets once and in the following timing part, we would read
the subsets from HDFS to the front end of R 3 times. </p>

<h5>Elapsed Time Measurement</h5>

<pre><code class="r">for (n in n.vec){
 for (rep in rep.vec) {

  ## timing for O
  type = &quot;O&quot;
  for (m in m.vec) {
    for (v in v.vec) {
      dir.dm = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/dm/&quot;,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      dir.nf = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/nf/&quot;,&quot;rep&quot;,rep,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      map2
      mr2
      t      = as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr2, async=FALSE)})[3])
      t      = data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
      timing = rbind(timing,t) 
    }
  }
  ## timing for T
  type = &quot;T&quot;
   for (m in m.vec) {
    for (v in v.vec) {
      dir.dm = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/dm/&quot;,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      dir.gf = paste(dir.exp,&quot;/gf/&quot;,&quot;rep&quot;,rep,&#39;n&#39;,n,&#39;v&#39;,v,&quot;m&quot;,m, sep=&quot;&quot;)
      mp3
      reduce3
      mr3
      t      = as.numeric(system.time({rhex(mr3, async=FALSE)})[3])
      t      = data.frame(rep=rep,n=n,m=m,v=v,type=type,t=t)
      timing = rbind(timing,t)   
    }
  }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first for-loop stands for the different values of <code>n</code>. For each fixed value of <code>n</code>, the second 
for-loop stands for the replicates. For each fixed value of <code>n</code> and <code>rep</code>, the third and forth 
for-loop is for differente combination of <code>m</code> and <code>v</code>. There is a single run of performance test for
any fixed <code>n</code>, <code>rep</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>v</code>. <code>dir.dm</code> and <code>dir.nf</code> seperately specify the input type and output
type for execution function <code>mr2</code>. The <code>dir.dm</code> and <code>dir.gf</code> seperately specify the input type and 
output type for execution function <code>mr3</code>. The <code>map2</code>, <code>map3</code>, <code>reduce3</code> are the map and reduce 
function we specified before.</p>

<p>Finally, we save our final results to a data frame called <code>timing</code>.</p>

<h4>Results of the Experiment of the Performance Test</h4>

...

</code></pre>

<p>The <code>timing</code> dataframe has 648 rows and 6 collumns because <code>n</code> has 4 different values, <code>type</code> has two levels, <code>m</code> has 9 different values and <code>v</code> has 3 different values. For each combination of the factors, we have 3 replicates. So we have \(4*2*9*3*3=648\) rows. </p>

<h5>Save the Results to the local</h5>

<p>Because the size of data frame <code>timing</code> is not very large, we can easily download the dataset to our local computer. But first, we need to save <code>timing</code> to the server front end.
Then we will copy this file from server to our local computer.</p>

<pre><code class="r">dir = &quot;/ln/song273/tmp&quot;
dir.local = &quot;/home/median/u41/song273/timetest/&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>dir</code> specifies the top level directory for experiment on HDFS. The <code>dir.local</code> specifies the 
directory for local cluster file system.</p>

<pre><code class="r">rhsave(timing, file=paste(dir, &quot;/save/&quot;, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;.RData&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;))
save(timing, file=paste(dir.local, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;.RData&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>The RHIPE function <code>rhsave</code> helps save the .RData file to the directory of <code>dir</code> on HDFS with file 
name <code>timing.RData</code>. The R function <code>save</code> write the <code>timing.RData</code> file to the local cluster file
Then we can use linux command <code>scp</code> to copy the file from the local cluster file to our local 
computer file.</p>

<pre><code class="r">scp song273@deneb.stat.purdue.edu:timing.RData /home/song273/elapsedtime
</code></pre>

<p>The linux command <code>scp</code> will copy the <code>timing.RData</code> file from the remote host <em>Deneb</em> to the local
host under the directory <code>elapsedtime</code>. Then we can analyse the data in our local computer which 
gives us more freedom to analysis, like we don&#39;t need to worry about the abrupt network fault.</p>

<h4>Visualize the Results</h4>

<p>Here we use R function <code>xyplot</code> to visualize the results.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and log subsets size <code>m</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_m_v.pdf">Elapsed time plots against <code>m</code></a>.</p>

<p>As we can see from the first plot, for every fixed value of <code>n</code> and <code>v</code>, the total elapsed time <strong>T</strong> 
decreases first and then increases later as the value of <code>m</code> changes. And the three different curves
in one pannel show the same drop-increase pattern.</p>

<ol>
<li>The second plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and log number of 
varibales <code>v</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_v_n.pdf">Elapsed time plots against <code>v</code></a>.</p>

<p>As we can see from the plot2, for fixed value of <code>m</code> , as the value of <code>v</code> increases, the value of 
log2(elapsed time) increases linearly in each panel of the plot.</p>

<ol>
<li>The third plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and log observations <code>n</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_n_v.pdf">Elapsed time plots against <code>n</code></a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>The forth plot describes the relationship between two kinds of elapsed time and 3 replicates.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="./plots/Elapsed_Time_rep_v.pdf">Elapsed time plots against Replicates</a>.</p>

<p>This plots helps to see whether replication has blocking effect on the elapsed time. Because R has 
temporary memory and we read the subsets from HDFS to the front end of R for the first time and R 
has temperory memory about these files and in the next replicate of reading part, R maybe just reads
these subsets from memory instead of reading them from the HDFS, which will affect our elpased time
experiment.</p>

<p>From the plot4, we can see that replication doesn&#39;t have the blocking effects.</p>
