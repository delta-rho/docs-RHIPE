## Installing Packages ##

### Background ###

You will likely want to install packages on your R
session server, for example, R CRAN packages. And you want these packages to
run on the Hadoop cluster as well. The mechanism for doing this is much like
what you have been using for packages in R, but adds a push of the packages to
the cluster nodes since you will want to use them there too. It is all quite
simple.

Standard R practice for a server with many R users is for a system
administrator to install R for use by all. However, you can
override this by installing your own version. It makes sense to follow this
practice in this setting too, and have the systems administrators install R
and `RHIPE` on the R session server and the Hadoop cluster.
(The `RHIPE` installation manual for system administrators is available in
these pages in the QuickStart section.) But you can override this and install
your own `RHIPE` and R, and push them to
the cluster along with any other packages you installed.
You do need to be careful to check versions of R, `RHIPE`, and
Hadoop for compatibility. The Tessera GitHub site has this information.

Now suppose you are using RMR on the Amazon cloud or Vagrant, both
discussed in our QuickStart section. Then installation of R
and RHIPE on the R session server and the push to the cluster 
has been taken care of for you. But if you want to install
R CRAN packages or packages from other sources you will need to understand the
installation mechanism.

There are some other installation matters that are the sole domain of the
system administrator. Obviously linux and Hadoop are. But also
protocol buffers must be installed on the Hadoop cluster to enable `RHIPE`
communication. In addition, if you want to use RStudio on the R session
server, the system administrator will need to install RStudio server on the R
session server. Now there is one caution here for both users and system
administrators to consider.  You are best served if the linux versions you
run are the same on the R server and cluster nodes, and also if the
hardware is the same. The first is more critical, but the second is a
nice bonus.  Part of the reason is that Java plays a critical roll in RHIPE,
and Java likes homogeneity.

### Install and Push ###

To install `Rhipe` on the R session server, you first download the package file
from within R

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
system("wget http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/rhipebin/Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz")

```
This puts the package in your R session directory.
There are other versions of `Rhipe`. You will need to go to Github to find out
about them.  To install the package on your R session server, run
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("testthat")
install.packages("rJava")
install.packages("Rhipe_0.74.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```
The first two R CRAN packages are used only for `RHIPE` installation.
You do not need them again until you reinstall.
`RHIPE` is now installed. Each time you startup an R session and you
want`RHIPE` to be available, you run
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(Rhipe)
rhinit()
```

Next, you push all the R packages you have installed on the R session 
server, including <code>RHIPE</code> onto the cluster HDFS.
First, you need the system administrator to configure the HDFS so
you can do both this and other analysis tasks where you need to write to the
HDFS. You need to have a directory on the HDFS where you have write permission.
A common convention is for the administrator is to set up for you
the directory `/yourloginname` using your login name, and do the same
thing for other users. We will assume that has happened.

Suppose in `/yourloginname` you want to create a directory `bin` on the
HDFS where you will push your installations on the R session server. You can
do this and carry out the push by
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
rhmkdir("/yourloginname/bin")
hdfs.setwd("/yourloginname/bin")
bashRhipeArchive("R.Pkg")
```
`rhmkdir()` creates your directory `bin` in the directory `yourloginname`.
`hdfs.setwd()` declares `/yourloginname/bin` to be the directory with your
choice of installations.  `bashRhipeArchive()` creates the actual archive of
your installations and names it as `R.Pkg`.

Each time your R code will require the installations on the HDFS, you
must in your R session run
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(Rhipe) rhinit()
rhoptions(zips = "/yourloginname/bin/R.Pkg.tar.gz")
rhoptions(runner = "sh ./R.Pkg/library/Rhipe/bin/RhipeMapReduce.sh")
```
