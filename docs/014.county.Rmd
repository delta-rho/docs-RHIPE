### Read and Divide by County ###
Our division method for the housing data will be to divide by county,
so there will be 2883 subsets. Each subset will be a `data.frame` object with 4
column variables: `date`, `units`, `listing`, and `selling`.
`FIPS`, `state`, and `county` are not column variables because each has only one
value for each county; their values are added to the `data.frame` as
attributes.

The first step is to read each line of the file `house.txt` into R. By
convention, `RHIPE` takes each line of a text file to be a key-value pair.
The line number is the key. The value is the data for the line, in our case
the 7 observations of the 7 variables of the data for one month and one county.

Each line is read as part of Map R code written by the user. The Map input
key-value pairs are the above line key-value pairs. Each line also has a Map
output key-value pair. The key identifies the county. `FIPS` could have been
enough to do this, but it is specified as a character vector with three
elements: the 3-vector values of `FIPS`, `state`, and `county`.
This is done so that later all three can be added to the subset `data.frame`.
The output value for each output key is the  observations of `date`, `units`,
`listing`, and `selling` from the line for that key.

The Map output key-value pairs are the input key-value pairs for the Reduce R
code written by the user. Reduce assembles these into groups by key,
that is, the county. Then the Reduce R code is applied to the output
values of  each group collectively to create the subset `data.frame` object
for each county. Each row is the value of one Reduce input key-value pair:
observations of `date`, `units`, `listing`, and `selling` for one housing unit.
`FIPS`, `state`, and `county` are added to the `data.frame` as attributes.
Finally, Reduce writes
each subset `data.frame` object to a directory in the HDFS specified by the
user.  The subsets are written as Reduce output key-value pairs.
The output keys are the the values of `FIPS`. The output values are the county
`data.frame` objects.

#### The RHIPE Manager: rhwatch() ####

We begin with the `RHIPE` R function `rhwatch()`. It
runs the R code you write to specify
Map and Reduce operations, takes your specification of input and
output files, and manages key-value pairs for you.

The code for the county division is
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
mr1 <- rhwatch(
  map      = map1,
  reduce   = reduce1,
  input    = rhfmt("/yourloginname/housing/housing.txt", type = "text"),
  output   = rhfmt("/yourloginname/housing/byCounty", type = "sequence"),
  readback = FALSE
)
```
Arguments `map` and `reduce` take your Map and Reduce R code, which will be
described below. `input` specifies the input to be the text file in the HDFS
that we put there earlier using `rhput()`. The file supplies input key-value
pairs for the Map code.  `output` specifies the file name
into which final output key-value pairs of the Reduce code that are written to
the HDFS. `rhwatch()` creates this file if it does not exist, or overwrites it
if it does not.

In our division by county here, the Reduce recombination outputs are the
2883 county `data.frame` R objects. They are a `list` object that describes the
key-value pairs: `FIPS` key and `data.frame` value. There is one `list` element
per pair; that element is itself a list with two elements, the `FIPS` key and
then the `data.frame` value.

The Reduce `list` output can also be written to the R global environment of
the R session. One use of this is analytic recombination in the R session
when the outputs are a small enough dataset. You can do this with the argument
`readback`.  If `TRUE`, the list is also written to the global environment.
If `FALSE`, it is not. If FALSE, it can be written latter using the RHIPE R
function `rhread()`.
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
countySubsets <- rhread("/yourloginname/housing/byCounty")
```
Suppose you just want to look over the `byCounty` file on the HDFS just to see
if all is well, but that this can be done by looking at a small number of
key-value pairs, say 10. The code for this is

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
countySubsets <- rhread("/yourloginname/housing/byCounty", max = 10)
```

```
Read 10 objects(31.39 KB) in 0.04 seconds
```
Then you can look at the list of length 10 in various was such as

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
keys <- unlist(lapply(countySubsets, "[[", 1))
keys
```
```
 [1] "01013" "01031" "01059" "01077" "01095" "01103" "01121" "04001" "05019" "05037"
```

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
attributes(countySubsets[[1]][[2]])
```
```
$names
[1] "date"             "units"            "listing"             "selling"

#### Map R Code ####
The Map R code for the county division is

```{r eval =FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
map1 <- expression({
  lapply(seq_along(map.keys), function(r) {
    line = strsplit(map.values[[r]], ",")[[1]]
    outputkey <- line[1:3]
    outputvalue <- data.frame(
      date = as.numeric(line[4]),
      units =  as.numeric(line[5]),
      listing = as.numeric(line[6]),
      selling = as.numeric(line[7]),
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
  rhcollect(outputkey, outputvalue)
  })
})
```
Map has input key-value pairs, and output key-value pairs. Each pair has an
identifier, the key, and numeric-categorical information, the value. 
The Map R code is applied to each input key-value pair, producing one
output key-value pair. Each application of the Map code to a
key-value pair is carried out by a mapper, and there are many mappers running
in parallel without communication (embarrassingly parallel) until the Map job
completes.

`RHIPE` creates input key-value pair `list` objects, `map.keys` and
`map.values`, based on information that it has.
Let `r` be an integer from 1 to the number of input key-value pairs.
`map.values[[r]]` is the value for key `map.keys[[r]]`.
The housing data inputs come from a text file in the HDFS, housing.txt,
By RHIPE convention, for a text file, each Map input key is a text file line
number, and the corresponding  Map input value is the observations in the line,
read into R as a single text string.
In our case each line value is the observations of the 7 county variables for the line.

This Map code is really a `for loop` with `r` as the looping variable,
but is done by `lapply()` because it is
in general faster than `for r in 1:length(map.keys)`.
The loop proceeds through the input keys, specified by the first argument of
`lapply`.  The second argument of the above `lapply` defines the Map expression
with the argument `r`, an index for the Map keys and values.

The function `strsplit()` splits each character-string line input value
into the individual observations of the text line. The result, `line`,
is a `list` of length one whose element is a `character vector` whose elements
are the line observations. In our case, the
observations are a `character vector` of length 7, in order:
`FIPS`, `county`, `state`, `date`, `units`, `listing`, `selling`.

Next we turn to the Map output key-value pairs.
`outputkey` for each text line is a character vector of length 3 with `FIPS`,
`county`, and `state`. `outputvalue` is a `data.frame` with one row
and 4 columns, the observations of `date`, `units`, `listing`, and `selling`, 
each a `numeric` object.

The argument of `data.frame`, `stringsAsFactors`, is
is given the value `FALSE`. This leaves character vectors in the `data.frame`
as is, and does on convert to a `factor`.

The RHIPE function `rhcollect()` forms a Map output key-value pair for each
line, and writes the results to the HDFS as a key-value pair `list` object.

#### Reduce R Code ####
The Reduce R code for the county division is

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
reduce1 <- expression(
  pre = {
    reduceoutputvalue <- data.frame()
  },
  reduce = {
    reduceoutputvalue <- rbind(reduceoutputvalue, do.call(rbind, reduce.values))
  },
  post = {
    reduceoutputkey <- reduce.key[1]
    attr(reduceoutputvalue, "location") <- reduce.key[1:3]
    names(attr(reduceoutputvalue, "location")) <- c("FIPS","county","state")
    rhcollect(reduceoutputkey, reduceoutputvalue)
  }
)
```

The output key-value pairs of Map are the input key-value pairs to Reduce.
The first task of Reduce is to group its input key-value pairs by unique key.
The Reduce R code is applied to the key-value pairs of each group by a
reducer. The number of groups varies in applications from just one, with a
single Reduce output, to many.
For multiple groups, the reducers run in parallel, without communication,
until the Reduce job completes.

`RHIPE` creates two list objects `reduce.key` and `reduce.values`.
Each element of `reduce.key` is the key for one group, and the corresponding
element of `reduce.values` has the values for the group to which the Reduce
code is applied..  Now in our case, the key is county and the values are the
observations of  `date`, `units`, `listing`, and `selling` for the all housing
units in the county.

Note the Reduce code has a certain structure: expressions `pre`, `reduce`,
and `post`. In our case `pre` initializes `reduceoutputvalue` to a
`data.frame()`. `reduce` assembles the county `data.frame` as the
reducer receives the values through `rbind(reduceoutputvalue, do.call(rbind,
reduce.values))`; this uses `rbind()` to add rows to the `data.frame` object.
`post` operates further on the result of `reduce`. In our case it first assigns
the observation of `FIPS` as the key. Then it adds `FIPS`,`county`, and
`state` as `attributes`. Finally the RHIPE function
`rhcollect()` forms a Reduce output key-value pair `list`, and writes it to the
HDFS.
